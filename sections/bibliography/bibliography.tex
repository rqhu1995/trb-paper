\subsection{Bibliography}
The TRB bibliography style is defined in the \verb1trb.bst1 file which should be in your document folder. A renewed command is specified, \verb1\citep{}1 which will print the authors and the number of the reference in the order in which it is supplied. Note that \verb1\citep{}1 prints both the author names and the reference number, if you simply need the number of the reference, use command
\verb|\cite{}|. The References section will be appended to the end of the document.

It is very easy to add reference to papers programs written by \citep{Bierlaire2003} and \citep{Bierlaire2008} or to papers like those written by \citep{Garrow2009} and \citep{Koppelman2005}. You can even go back and refer to Biog\'eme by \citep{Bierlaire2008} a second time. You can also cite a group of similar references without printing author names \cite{TRBGuide,Bierlaire2003}. This template also groups multiple reference numbers together if there are three or more consecutive numbers \cite{Bierlaire2003,Bierlaire2008,Garrow2009,Koppelman2005}.
